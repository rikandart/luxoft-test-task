Please implement the two functions using the provided framework:

a) Safe multiplication of two signed integers.
b) Calculation of the intersection point of two straight lines.
Each line is given as two points with signed integer coordinates.

The project has the following structure: 

/mathematics - Library of mathematical functions.
/geometry - Library of geometry primitives and functions.
/cmocka-1.1.0 - unit test framework. 

To build a project, use CMake at least version 3.0. 

To solve this task you need to implement all necessary functions
in the specified libraries (expand them and, if necessary, add the missing functions)
and cover them with unit tests.

Please note that some unit tests are already implemented.

The programming language used is C99.

All comments, descriptions, READMEs etc must be written in English.
